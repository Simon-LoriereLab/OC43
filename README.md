#Genomics of the human coronavirus OC43
This repository analyzes genomes of HKU1 using Nextstrain in collaboration with Pr Jérôme Le Goff and colleagues at Saint Louis hospital in Paris and the French National Reference Center for viruses of respiratory infections. 
  
The built was constructed using a total of 46 publicly available full-length genomes. Of note, there is evidence of recombination in the evolutionary history of HCoV-OC43.
 
The phylogeny can be visualized at https://nextstrain.org/community/Simon-LoriereLab/OC43@main/all
